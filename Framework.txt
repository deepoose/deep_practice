Automation Frameworks[4]:

1. Modular:
		Identify the reusable steps in different testcases and convert them into a method
2. Data Driven
		Maintenance of Input data in different formats such as 
			testng.xml,xls,xlsx,database
3. Keyword:
		Associate the reusable methods with the keywords and invoke the keywords to execute the steps

4. Hybrid****: 3 classes +Modular + DataDriven

		AppLibrary.java
		Helperclass.java
		BaseClass.java

What is the automation framework used in the Project?

We are using the Hybrid Framewokr in our project where it includes Modular + Data Driven
In Modular we identify   the reusable steps in different testcases and convert them into a method
		login()
In Data Driven we maintain the Input data in different formats such as 
			testng.xml,xls,xlsx
And also we maintain the methods in different classes such as 
		AppLibrary.java -> Reusable java methods
		Helperclass.java->Reusable selenium methods useful for different modules - patient & admin
					Example: login,naviagtion methods
		BaseClass.java
					This class is a parent class has been extended by every test class
					Objective of the class to instantiate the driver and driver variable is protected.


Design Pattern : Page Object Model:
-------------------------------------------------
to associate the methods into different pageobject classes.
for easy maintenance
to reduce duplication of the code

GitHub Pre-Requisite:
1. Create a 2 Github account with 2 different gmail id's.
2. Create a Repository
3. Add a file
4. PERform changes
5. Review the commit id
